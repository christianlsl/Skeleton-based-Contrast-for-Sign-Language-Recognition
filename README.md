# SC^2_CSLR
This repo holds codes of the paper: SC2SLR: Skeleton-based Contrast for Sign Language Recognition

This repo is based on [VAC (ICCV 2021)](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Min_Visual_Alignment_Constraint_for_Continuous_Sign_Language_Recognition_ICCV_2021_paper.html) and [SEN_CSLR]([hulianyuyy/SEN_CSLR: Self-Emphasizing Network for Continuous Sign Language Recognition (AAAI2023 Oral) (github.com)](https://github.com/hulianyuyy/SEN_CSLR)). 

## Prerequisites

- This project is implemented in Pytorch (>1.8). Thus please install Pytorch first.

- ctcdecode==0.4 [[parlance/ctcdecode]](https://github.com/parlance/ctcdecode)，for beam search decode.

- sclite [[kaldi-asr/kaldi]](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi), install kaldi tool to get sclite for evaluation. After installation, create a soft link toward the sclite: 
  `mkdir ./software`
  `ln -s PATH_TO_KALDI/tools/sctk-2.4.10/bin/sclite ./software/sclite`

- [SeanNaren/warp-ctc](https://github.com/SeanNaren/warp-ctc) for ctc supervision.

- [AlphaPose]([MVIG-SJTU/AlphaPose: Real-Time and Accurate Full-Body Multi-Person Pose Estimation&Tracking System (github.com)](https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/AlphaPose))



## Data Preparation
### PHOENIX2014 dataset
1. Download the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014 Dataset [[download link]](https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~koller/RWTH-PHOENIX/). Our experiments based on phoenix-2014.v3.tar.gz.

2. After finishing dataset download, extract it. It is suggested to make a soft link toward downloaded dataset.   
   `ln -s PATH_TO_DATASET/phoenix2014-release ./dataset/phoenix2014`

3. The original image sequence is 210x260, we resize it to 256x256 for augmentation. Run the following command to generate gloss dict and resize image sequence.     

   ```bash
   cd ./preprocess
   python data_preprocess.py --process-image --multiprocessing
   ```

### PHOENIX2014-T dataset
1. Download the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014 Dataset [[download link]](https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~koller/RWTH-PHOENIX-2014-T/)

2. After finishing dataset download, extract it. It is suggested to make a soft link toward downloaded dataset.   
   `ln -s PATH_TO_DATASET/PHOENIX-2014-T-release-v3/PHOENIX-2014-T ./dataset/phoenix2014-T`

3. The original image sequence is 210x260, we resize it to 256x256 for augmentation. Run the following command to generate gloss dict and resize image sequence.     

   ```bash
   cd ./preprocess
   python data_preprocess-T.py --process-image --multiprocessing
   ```



### Training

```python
python main.py --device your_device
```
